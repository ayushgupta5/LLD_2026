# Your First Steps into AI: Session 1 Guide

Welcome! You've just completed your first session learning about AI. This guide breaks down everything in simple terms so you can review and practice what you learned.

## **What is AI? Understanding the Basics**

Think of AI as a really smart assistant that can help you with work tasks. There are two main types you should know:

- **Generative AI**: This creates new things for you - like writing emails, making images, or drafting reports. It's like having a creative partner who can write, design, and brainstorm with you.

- **Agentic AI**: This is AI that can complete tasks on its own. Tell it what you need done, and it figures out how to do it step-by-step. Think of it as a helper who can follow through on entire projects.

**The Big Picture**: AI won't replace you at work. Instead, people who know how to use AI will replace people who don't. That's why you're here!

## **Your New Role: The AI Generalist**

An **AI Generalist** is someone who knows how to use different AI tools to solve problems. You don't need to be a programmer or tech expert - you just need to know which tool to use and how to ask it the right questions.

**What makes a good AI Generalist?**
- Knowing what different AI tools can do
- Picking the right tool for each job
- Focusing on solving real problems
- Understanding how AI fits into your work (marketing, design, analysis, etc.)

## **The Most Important Skill: Talking to AI**

The better you ask, the better results you get. Here's the simple formula:

### **The 4-Part Prompt Formula**

Every time you ask AI for help, include these four things:

1. **Role**: Tell the AI who to act like
   - Example: "You are a helpful email writer"

2. **Task**: Say exactly what you want
   - Example: "Write a professional email"

3. **Instructions**: Give specific details
   - Example: "Make it friendly, keep it under 100 words, and include a call to action"

4. **Data**: Provide any information the AI needs
   - Example: "The email is to thank a customer for their recent purchase"

**Full Example**:
```
You are a helpful email writer. Write a professional email to thank a customer for their recent purchase. Make it friendly, keep it under 100 words, and include a call to action asking them to leave a review. The customer's name is Sarah and she bought a coffee maker.
```

### **Simple Tricks to Get Better Results**

- **Be Specific**: Instead of "write about coffee," say "write 3 paragraphs about the health benefits of coffee for busy professionals"

- **Show Examples**: If you want a specific style, show the AI an example of what you like

- **Ask for Steps**: Add "explain your thinking step-by-step" when you need AI to solve problems

- **Ask for Improvements**: Tell the AI to review and improve its own answer
