Design CourseRegistrationSystem Low Level Design :-

#Functional Requirements:
1. User Registration and Authentication
2. Course Listing and Search
3. Course Enrollment
4. Payment Processing
5. Enrollment History and Management
#Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Performance: The system should handle high traffic during peak enrollment periods with minimal latency.
2. Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate a growing user base and increasing number of courses.
3. Security: Ensure secure handling of user data and payment information.
4. Usability: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
